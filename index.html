            CSS is a great tool for styling. It's simple, elegant and powerful. We can make a basic 
            page look wow with some good CSS. CSS is all  about styling your page. But a good design
            will always have a defined frame of the page. More the frame is organized, easier and better it
            is to style. So how do we create a basic frame of the page? Here's how..
            <br><br>
            Before you start styling yor page, always have a container for the content. More the containers
            better it is. Always have a container that holds all your content. And inside this also try creating
            blocks and sub-blocks. Because when you have content inside a container, it is very easy to style it.
            <br><br>
            The best possible container to choose is a flexbox. With a flexbox you can arrange the blocks in the
            required manner, you can decide the space between each content piece, you can design the direction of
            content, should the block remain in same size or change based on amount of content? and so on.. So always
            try having your containers as flexbox. Here are a few flex properties that will help you in future:
            <br><br>
            <pre>
                display:flex;
                justify-content:space evenly;
                flex-direction:column/row;
                flex-grow/flex-shrink:1/0;

            </pre>
            There are many more options that you can research and implement on flexbox but these are the 
            basic ones that help you define your container.
